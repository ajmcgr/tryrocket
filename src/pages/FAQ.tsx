const FAQS = [
  { q: "What does Rocket generate?", a: "Rocket is a logo-first design tool. Start with logo directions — a logo mark, matching wordmark, icon, colours and typography — then refine your favourite in the editor and roll it into a Brand Kit." },
  { q: "What are the main workflows?", a: "Four surfaces: Wizard (guided chat that generates logo directions from a URL or idea), Logo Designer & Icon Designer (batch generate marks and app icons in a chosen style), Templates (200+ ready-made logo and icon starters), and Saved (every design you star or open in the editor)." },
  { q: "How does the Brand Kit work?", a: "Every Brand Kit holds one canonical item per category — logo, colours, typography, design system, and more. Swap or remove any item; Remove sends it to Trash and you can restore within 30 days. Add extras from any saved design via 'Use in brand kit'." },
  { q: "Can I edit designs like Canva?", a: "Yes. The editor supports multi-select (Shift-click + marquee), drag-resize, colour overlays for logos and images, image uploads with resize, layers on the right panel, Quick Edit for title/slogan/icon/layout/background, and export to PNG, SVG, PDF or ZIP." },
  { q: "How long does a generation take?", a: "Most logo batches land in 30–60 seconds. Your chat history persists per project so you can scroll back and iterate on earlier prompts." },
  { q: "Can I regenerate individual pieces?", a: "Yes. Every result has Edit, Save, Variants and Remix. Regenerating one design costs 1 credit; you can steer it with feedback like 'more minimal' or 'brighter'." },
  { q: "What's a credit?", a: "Credits power every generation. Free plan includes 100 credits/month, Pro includes 3,000. Top up anytime with credit packs — they never expire." },
  { q: "How does sharing and export work?", a: "Every design opens in the editor via a shareable link (new tab). Export PNG, SVG, PDF, or a full ZIP of your Brand Kit. Pro adds password-protected share links and PDF/Markdown brand guidelines." },
  { q: "What's included in Pro?", a: "3,000 credits/month, workspaces & multi-seat, password-protected share links, brand guideline exports, and priority AI capacity. 7 days free, cancel anytime." },
  { q: "Can I cancel anytime?", a: "Yes, from Settings → Manage Billing. You keep access until the end of the period." },
